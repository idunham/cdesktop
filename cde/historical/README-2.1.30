THE PURPOSE OF THIS RELEASE

	This is the third maintenance release for CDE and Motif 2.1.
	It was designed to resolve as many defects as possible from the
	project's defect database.  This maintenance release resolves 515
	problem reports against CDE and Motif 2.1.20.


	The Open Group encourages the reporting of all bugs found in CDE
	and Motif regardless of the platform or hardware configuration in 
	which the bug is found.  However, The Open Group will commit to 
	accept (and repair according to priority) only those bugs that can 
	be replicated on the current reference configurations.  


DOWNLOAD INSTRUCTIONS

	This section describes how to unload the release archives
	available at this ftp site.

	The CDE/Motif 2.1.30 release is provided as compressed tar archives.  


  	README-2.1.30         - this file

  	cde.tar.Z             - a compressed tar file of the 
			        CDE 2.1.30 source code

  	cde-test.tar.Z        - a compressed tar file of the 
			        CDE 2.1.30 tests

  	cde-test-misc.tar.Z   - a compressed tar file of 
			        test results for CDE/Motif 2.1.30

  	motif.tar.Z           - a compressed tar file of the 
			        MOTIF 2.1.30 source code

  	motif-test-misc.tar.Z - a compressed tar file of 
			        test results for Motif 2.1.30


	The CDE/Motif 2.1.30 release is in the form of a sparse tree; that 
	is, it contains only files that have been modified in either CDE or 
	Motif since the 2.1.20 release.  If you are a CDE licensee you will 
	receive files for both CDE and Motif.  If you are a Motif-only 
	licensee you will receive files just for Motif.

	After ftp-ing the files to your machine, you should first uncompress
	the compressed (*.Z) files with the command:
	
    		uncompress <filename>.Z
	
	Once the tar archives have been uncompressed, you can untar each
	with the command:
	
    		tar xvf <filename>.tar
	
	This command will preserve the .tar file while unloading its contents
	into your current working directory.  If you wish to list a table of
	contents of the tar file before actually unloading it you can do so
	with the command:
	
    		tar tvf <filename>.tar
	

INSTALLING THIS RELEASE

	This release is made up of a "sparse tree" of files that have changed
	since release 2.1.20. The new versions of the files should replace the
	corresponding CDE or Motif 2.1.20 versions of the files in your source 
	tree. 


	After the release is unloaded, you can use, for example, cp -R command
	to copy the sources from the current directory into your source tree.
	This release creates several new files.  If you are using a symbolic
	link tree, you will need to create new links for them.

	Please see the Release Notes from 2.1 for instructions on building
	a full release tree.
	

IMPORTANT CHANGES IN THIS RELEASE

Defect Repair

	This patch release resolves 515 problem reports against CDE and 
	Motif 2.1.20.  Each of these defects were resolved in one of three
	ways: fixed (problem was recreated and repaired), duplicate 
	(problem was already reported and recorded in defect database), 
	or canceled (problem could not be recreated in current code
	base).  The breakdown by component and resolution type is:

FIXED:		Total  370 

	CDE Code:   95 	 	Motif Code:  91
	CDE Doc:     1 	 	Motif Doc:    0
	CDE Test:  110 	 	Motif Test:  73
	--------------		---------------
	Total:     206 		Total:      164 

DUPLICATE:	Total  62 

	CDE Code:   4 	 	Motif Code:  10
	CDE Doc:    0 	 	Motif Doc:    0
	CDE Test:  19 	 	Motif Test:  29
	--------------		---------------
	Total:     23 		Total:       39 

CANCEL:		Total  83 

	CDE Code:  18 	 	Motif Code:  30
	CDE Doc:    0 	 	Motif Doc:    0
	CDE Test:  13 	 	Motif Test:  22
	--------------		---------------
	Total:     31 		Total:       52 


	For more information on the bugs resolved, see the file 
	CLOSEDBUGS in this release.

	As of the completion of this maintenance release there are no
	open defects against the CDE and Motif code and tests that have a
	priority of 1 or a severity of 1.

Security
	This release contains changes to address a number of security
	vulnerabilities in CDE that were reported to CERT during 1999.
	Those vulnerabilities are described in the CERT Advisory CA-99-11,
	Four Vulnerabilities in the Common Desktop Environment.  A full
	description can be found on the CERT Web site at
	http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-99-11-CDE.html.

	A subset of those changes were released to the affected vendors
	via the CERT working group formed to address the reported problems.
	This release also includes additional changes to various CDE
	desktop facilities to sense access violations and report them
	to the user.

BUG LISTS

	In the release archive there are two files, OPENBUGS and 
	CLOSEDBUGS, which contain, respectively, the list of all bugs 
	from any version of CDE or Motif not yet closed, and all bugs 
	from CDE or Motif fixed in this patch release.


BUILDING MOTIF FOR YOUR SYSTEM

	Since X11 is NOT being delivered as part of this release, there
	are some minor changes in the build process for Motif with respect
	to the build process described in the 2.1 Release Notes.

	Replace step 2 under the Building Motif subsection of Section 3:

	  2.  If you are building with imports (the default setup in site.def),
	      construct the necessary links as follows:

	      % cd $CDEBUILDDIR/motif
	      % mkdir -p imports/x11
	      % cd imports/x11
	      % ln -s <X11_bin_directory> bin
	      % ln -s <X11_includes_directory> includes
	      % ln -s <X11_libs_directory> libs


REFERENCE PLATFORMS

	The Open Group has used a number of platforms during the
	development of the 2.1.30 release.  However, the following
	reference platforms are the only ones where the complete
	test cycle was run.  Test results appear below.


   CDE and Motif:
	HP9000/7xx running HP-UX 10.20
	Sun SPARCstation running Solaris 2.4
		using the SC 4.0 C compiler and SC 4.1 C++ compilers

	Note that the Validation Suite for Motif (VSM) was also run on a
	Digital AlphaStation 200 running Digital UNIX 4.0D.  Results were
	consistent with those on the reference platforms and are included
	in the test results archives.

   
   Changes to X11R6.4:

	CDE and Motif 2.1.30 have been built and tested upon a base of 
	X11R6.4 patchlevel 3.  During the development of 2.1.20, a 
	significant defect in the I18N code of X was discovered; if you have
	not yet corrected this problem, you are advised to do so prior
	to making use of 2.1.30.

	The symptom is that when XMODIFIERS is not set, there is a possibility
	of memory corruption.   It is recommended that the following patch 
	be applied:
