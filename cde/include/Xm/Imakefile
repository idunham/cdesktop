HEADERS = XmPrivate.h

BuildIncludes($(HEADERS),Xm,..)

XCOMM XmPrivate must be generated manually.  For this you work, you must have
XCOMM a freshly compiled openmotif tree, and MLIBSRC must be pointing to it.

XmPrivate.h: 
	awk -f extractprototype.awk $(MLIBSRC)/Xm/$(ALLHEADERS) > $@ || rm -f $@
