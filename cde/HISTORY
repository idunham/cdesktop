# 2.2.0d (beta) 05/30/2013

- We are being bold this time, and promoting CDE to Beta.

- More work on dtinfo.  It now mostly compiles but is not quite ready
  for prime time.  It is not built be default.

- dtksh now builds on linux systems.

- We do not build Motif man pages anymore.

- X11 screensaver extension support now works in dtsession on Linux.

- Some screen locking issues on the BSD's have been fixed.

- /usr/sbin/sendmail is now the default mailer on OpenBSD 

- Basic support for Xinerama has been added to dtlogin and dtsession
  using a new DtXinerama library.

- Resolve many more more compiler warnings


# 2.2.0c (alpha) 10/4/2012

- Many 64b issues have been fixed, related to XtVaGetValues(), missing
  prototypes, erroneous assumptions regarding the size of ints and
  pointers, etc.  Many still lurk in the shadows.

- help files should build now on 64b systems with compiler
  optimization enabled.

- FreeBSD is pretty much fully functional now.  OpenBSD and NetBSD are
  close behind.

- FreeBSD uses a authorized FreeBSD Foundation specific logo on
  dtlogin.

- a few hundred more compiler warnings fixed :)

- more missing prototypes added to XmPrivate.h


# 2.2.0b (alpha) 9/6/2012

- This release incoporates approximately 200 patches from various
  people around the planet.

- initial BSD (OpenBSD, FreeBSD) support.

- wider support for various Linux distributions - Redhat, Arch,
  Ubuntu/Kubuntu/Xubuntu.  See a full list of currently operational
  platforms and their statuses at:

  https://sourceforge.net/p/cdesktopenv/wiki/SupportedPlatforms/

- many fixes to better support 64b systems.  There is still much work
  needed in this regard.

- most modules are operational.  dtinfo is not operational on any
  platform yet.  dtksh is not yet operational on linux systems.

- several thousand compiler warnings have been addressed.
  Unfortunately, there are still several thousand more waiting :(
  Some of this code is *old*.


# 2.2.0a (alpha) 8/6/2012

- This is the initial release of CDE form The Open Group based on
  2.1.30.   

  Minimal changes to get it compiling on some common linux distros,
  primarily 32bit.
