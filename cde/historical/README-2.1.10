THE PURPOSE OF THIS RELEASE

	This is the first maintenance release for CDE and Motif 2.1.
	It was designed to resolve as many defects as possible from the
	project's defect database, with a concentration for CDE on dtmail
	problems.  This maintenance release resolves 523 problem reports 
	against CDE and Motif 2.1.


	The Open Group encourages the reporting of all bugs found in CDE
	and Motif regardless of the platform or hardware configuration in 
	which the bug is found.  However, The Open Group will commit to 
	accept (and repair according to priority) only those bugs that can 
	be replicated on the current reference configurations.  



DOWNLOAD INSTRUCTIIONS

	This section describes how to unload the release archives
	available at this ftp site, including information about how much 
	disk space is required.

	The CDE/Motif 2.1.10 release is provided as compressed tar archives.  



  	README-2.1.10         - this file

  	cde.tar.Z             - a compressed tar file of the 
			        CDE 2.1.10 source code

  	cde-test.tar.Z        - a compressed tar file of the 
			        CDE 2.1.10 tests

  	cde-test-misc.tar.Z   - a compressed tar file of 
			        test results for CDE/Motif 2.1.10

  	motif.tar.Z           - a compressed tar file of the 
			        MOTIF 2.1.10 source code

  	motif-test-misc.tar.Z - a compressed tar file of 
			        test results for Motif 2.1.10

	The CDE/Motif 2.1.10 release is in the form of a sparse tree; that 
	is, it contains only files that have been modified in either CDE or 
	Motif since the 2.1 release.  If you are a CDE licensee you will 
	receive files for both CDE and Motif.  If you are a Motif-only 
	licensee you will receive files just for Motif.

	To download the archives from the ftp site you will need approximately
	18.5 megabytes (for CDE licensees) or 9.3 megabytes (for Motif-only 
	licensees) of disk space to hold just the compressed archives.  Once the 
	archives have been downloaded they should be first uncompressed and then 
	untarred (see instructions below).  The uncompressed archives require 
	approximately 91 (CDE) or 37 (Motif-only) megabytes.  After untarring 
	the archives, you will need an additional 96 (CDE) or 52 (Motif-only) 
	megabytes of space to hold the unloaded directories.  Once the tar 
	operation has completed you may wish to remove the tar archive files 
	(*tar).

  	Mb       	Mb		Files

  	52       	96		untarred archives
	
  	89       	187		Total 
	
	 
	After ftp-ing the files to your machine, you should first uncompress
	the compressed (*.Z) files with the command:
	
    		uncompress <filename>.Z
	
	Once the tar archives have been uncompressed, you can untar each
	with the command:
	
    		tar xvf <filename>.tar
	
	This command will preserve the .tar file while unloading its contents
	into your current working directory.  If you wish to list a table of
	contents of the tar file before actually unloading it you can do so
	with the command:
	
    		tar tvf <filename>.tar
	

INSTALLING THIS RELEASE

	This release is made up of a "sparse tree" of files that have changed
	since release 2.1. The new versions of the files should replace the
	corresponding CDE or Motif 2.1 versions of the files in your source 
	tree. 


	After the release is unloaded, you can use, for example, cp -R command
	to copy the sources from the current directory into your source tree.
	This release creates several new files.  If you are using a symbolic
	link tree, you will need to create new links for them.

	Please see the Release Notes from 2.1 for instructions on building
	a full release tree.
	

IMPORTANT CHANGES IN THIS RELEASE


	The majority of changes in this release are for general defect
	repair in the code and tests.  Additionally, some focused work
	was performed in the following areas described below: 

		X11R6.4 and XtMalloc
		Dtmail maintenance
		Japanese Translations


Defect Repair

	This patch release resolves 523 problem reports against CDE and 
	Motif 2.1.  Each of these defects were resolved in one of three
	ways: fixed (problem was recreated and repaired), duplicate 
	(problem was already reported and recorded in defect database), 
	or cancelled (problem could not be recreated in current code
	base).  The breakdown by component and resolution type is:

	FIXED:  Total 326  

		CDE Code: 160		Motif Code: 91
		    Doc:    2		      Test: 18

X11R6.4 and XtMalloc

	The Open Group is comitted to a unified desktop technology
	(X, Motif and CDE).  Therefore we built and tested CDE and
	Motif 2.1.10 against a pre-release version of X11R6.4.  Once
	the final release of X11R6.4 is ready we will build and test
	with it.  We do not expect to find any problems running with
	the production version but will provide any fixes if 
	necessary.

	One important change that went into the X11R6.4 release was 
	to fix the behavior of XtMalloc.  The specification clearly 
	state that XtMalloc should behave like the underlying malloc
	when passed a size of 0 (zero).  The old XtMalloc would
	allocate space, even if it was passed a size of 0.  In X11R6.4 
	XtMalloc no longer has this behavior.  On some platforms this
	can cause failures with faulty code that depends on that 
	behavior.

	We have found such calls in both the CDE and Motif code through 
	our test cycle and by visual inspection and have repaired them
	along the way.  There is the potential for additional problems
	of this form - developers should be alert to this possibility.

	If developers want the old behavior of XtMalloc then they should 
	define both MALLOC_0_RETURNS_NULL and XTMALLOC_BC in their
	site.def file.
 

Dtmail maintenance

	In addition to intensive efforts to fix outstanding defects
	throughout CDE and Motif, we paid special attention to problems
	in the CDE 2.1.10 Mailer.  These problems include the following:

	- Support for X11R6 Session Management Protocol
	- Unified mailbox menus
	- Support for mail aliases
	- Support for mail retrieval from standard mail servers


   Support for X11R6 Session Management Protocol 

	The CDE 2.1.10 Mailer now supports the basic elements of the 
	X11R6 Session Management Protocol including responding to 
	interactive and non-interactive SaveYourself requests as well 
	as Die requests.  For non-interactive SaveYourself requests, 
	the Mailer simply saves the size and location of all the 
	mailbox and compose windows.  Deleted messages in mailboxes are 
	retained.  For interactive SaveYourself requests, the Mailer may 
	display dialogs asking the user to verify that deleted messages 
	should be expunged or that the contents of compose windows
	should be deleted.


   Unified file selection menus

	The CDE 2.1.10 Mailer now provides a consistent set of menus 
	and file selection boxes for all operations involving mailboxes.  
	These operations include Mailbox->Open, Message->CopyTo, and Move.  
	Previously, each of these commands had its own file selection box.  
	Changes made in one FSB were not reflected in any of the others.  
	In addition, the Mailbox->Open command did not provide users with 
	the menu of predefined mailboxes as in the Message->CopyTo, and 
	Move commands.  In the CDE 2.1.10 Mailer the operation of all 
	three commands has been made completely consistent from the user's
	perspective.

	Similar fixes were made for all operations involving files 
	including Message->SaveAsText and Attachments->SaveAs.


   Support for mail aliases

	Popup menus containing the user's predefined aliases were added to 
	the address fields (To:, Cc:, and Bcc:) in the message composer 
	dialogs.  The user can now add an addressee to one of these fields 
	simply by selecting from the menu of aliases.


   Support for mail retrieval from standard mail servers

	The CDE 2.1.10 Mailer has been fixed to support retrieving mail 
	from standard mail servers.  Supported Mail Server protocols 
	include POP2, POP3, APOP, and IMAP.  However, to date, only the 
	POP3 has been well tested at The Open Group.


Japanese Translations

	Deliverables of the CDE 2.1 project included translations of
	all documentation.  The Japanese translations were not received
	in time for the 2.1 release but were delivered at the beginning
	of this year.  They were made available electronically at that
	time to licensees and have also been included in this 2.1.10 
	release.  This includes Japanese manual pages and books.


BUG LISTS

	In the release archive there are two files, OPENBUGS and 
	CLOSEDBUGS, which contain, respectively, the list of all bugs 
	from any version of CDE or Motif not yet closed, and all bugs 
	from CDE or Motif fixed in this patch release.


BUILDING MOTIF FOR YOUR SYSTEM

	This release requires no changes in the build process. Please
	refer to the Release Notes for more information. 


REFERENCE PLATFORMS

	The Open Group has used a number of platforms during the
	development of the 2.1.10 release.  However, the following
	reference platforms are the only ones where the complete
	test cycle was run.  Test results appear below.


   CDE and Motif:
	HP9000/7xx running HP-UX 10.20
	Digital Alpha 3000 running Digital Unix 4.0

   Motif-only:
	Sun SPARCstation running Solaris 2.4
		using the SC 4.0 C compiler and SC 4.1 C++ compilers


TEST RESULTS SUMMARY

	Since this is a general availability release, it has undergone 
	the full quality assurance cycle at The Open Group.  The test
	cycle includes running the following test suites:

		MVS  - Motif Validation Suite
		QATS - Motif Quality Assurance Test Suite
		CDE Regression Tests
		CDE Performance Tests
		Memory Tests

	The results of these test runs can be found in the release
	archive under cde-test-misc/reports/cde2.1.10.
