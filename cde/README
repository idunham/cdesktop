Purpose of this release:

This release under a new license is numbered 2.2.0. It is almost identical to
the 2.1.30 release The Open Group made available to customers in 1999 but with
additional improvements to allow it to build under Linux. It's not called 
2.1.30 to avoid confusion with versions of 2.1.30 not built from the open source 
code.
